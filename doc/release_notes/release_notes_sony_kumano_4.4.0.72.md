Thanks to all who have provided testing, reported bugs or have contributed otherwise.

# Functionality

The devices have the same functionality level as the Xperia 10 II port made by Jolla,
except in areas such as VoLTE where public packages are missing or in relation to Sailfish X features which are (currently) unavailable.

# Known issues

+ [SailfishOS-SonyXperia/bugs#33](https://github.com/SailfishOS-SonyXperia/bugs/issues/33)

    + Because of a missing package inside the adaptation-common repository Windows binaries for flashing are missing inside
       the zip archive. To workaround that issue have added another zip file that includes these files as "droid-flashingtools.zip" to this release.
+ [SailfishOS-SonyXperia/bugs#37](https://github.com/SailfishOS-SonyXperia/bugs/issues/37)
   + The launcher icons on the Xperia 1 are to small because there's no bigger graphics-theme size than 2.0.

## About

The goal of this project is to port additional Sony devices on top of Jolla's existing adaptations while staying as close as possible to the existing ports and contributing back to the upstream where possible.

Most of the changes from Jolla ports are adopted in both directions since the issues that one port has usually apply to the sister device of the same generation (e.g. Xperia 10 II -> Xperia 1/5).
This is the reason why changes from Jollaâ€™s port end up in the changelog for these port,
in many cases because they also affect the specific port but not always.

Where possible changes that were done for this port go back to the _Mer-Hybris_ repositories such as the kernel or droid repositories.

The project is open for anyone that wishes to port additional Sony devices to Sailfish OS. Feel free to suggest new features, provide bug reports or to contribute.
